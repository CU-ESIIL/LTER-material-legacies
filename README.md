Welcome to the CU-ESIIL repository, part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository serves as the central hub for our research at ESIIL, hosting your project description, proposals, bio, codebase, and more.

## Effects of material legacies of foundation species on ecosystem resilience at LTER sites
The dead remains of habtitat-forming organisms, known as material legacies, can influecne ecoloigcal processes during periods of recovery after disturbance, and thereby shape ecosystem resilience. Using the NSF Long Term Ecological Research network, we aim to quantify the effects of material legacies of foundation species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

## Project Proposal
Under global change, contemporary ecosystems are subject to shifting regimes of disturbance that create novel environmental conditions in which ecosystem recovery takes place. An emerging focus of ecology is to understand how material legacies – biogenic material left after disturbance – affect patterns of community assembly and properties of resilience (i.e., the rate and extent of ecosystem recovery). A particularly unresolved aspect of this focus is how the material legacies of foundation species (organisms that create the biological structures of ecosystems) affect ecosystem resilience. Here, we aim to leverage the LTER network to assess material legacy effects on ecosystem resilience across 12 terrestrial and marine ecosystem types. Specifically, we will utilize time series of ecosystem response metrics and material legacies following disturbances to evaluate the rate and extent of ecosystem recovery (Objective 1). Then, we will create a qualitative summary of the types of material legacies in each system, the ecological processes they influence, and the effects these legacies have on resilience (Objective 2). This research will help us achieve a generalized understanding of the impacts of material legacies and ensure we are best equipped to manage these legacies as they become more or less prevalent under changing global conditions.

## Customize Your Repository

As a new working group, you'll want to make this repository your own. Here's how to get started:

1. **Edit This Readme**: Replace the placeholder content with information about your specific project. Ensure that the introduction, project overview, and objectives clearly reflect your group's research focus.

2. **Update Bio**: Add details about your expertise, role in the project, and professional background. Include links to personal or professional web pages to foster community engagement and collaboration.

3. **Organize Your Code**: Structure your codebase in a way that is logical and accessible. Use directories and clear naming conventions to make it easy for all members to find and contribute to different parts of the project.

4. **Document Your Data**: Include a data directory with README files explaining the datasets, sources, and any preprocessing steps. This will help new members understand and work with the project's data effectively.

5. **Outline Your Methods**: Create a detailed METHODS.md file where you describe the methodologies, software, and tools you will be using in your research. This transparency will support reproducibility and collaborative development.

6. **Set Up Project Management**: Utilize the 'Issues' and 'Projects' features on GitHub to track tasks, discuss ideas, and manage your workflow. This can help in maintaining a clear view of progress and priorities.

7. **Add a License**: Choose and include an appropriate open-source license for your project, ensuring that the broader community understands how they can use and contribute to your work.

8. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Establish a CONTRIBUTING.md file with instructions for members on how to propose changes, submit issues, and contribute code.

9. **Review and Merge Workflow**: Decide on a workflow for reviewing and merging changes. Will you use branch protection? Who will have merge privileges? Document this process to avoid confusion.

10. **Establish Communication Channels**: Beyond GitHub, set up additional communication channels like Slack, Discord, or email lists for quick and informal discussions.

Remember, the goal is to make your repository clear, accessible, and useful for all current and future members of your working group. Happy researching!
